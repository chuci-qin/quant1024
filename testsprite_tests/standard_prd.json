  "product_overview": "quant1024 is a multi-source quantitative trading toolkit designed for structured data retrieval and real-time trading. It supports multiple exchanges, financial data providers, and blockchain sources, providing unified and standardized interfaces for market data, trading, and position management within a modular Python backend ecosystem.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide an extensible base class for creating and backtesting custom quantitative trading strategies.",
    "Facilitate performance evaluation through utility functions calculating returns and Sharpe ratio.",
    "Enable seamless integration with multiple exchanges via a unified interface and modular API design.",
    "Aggregate multi-source market and financial data for analysis and backtesting with adapters supporting exchanges, Yahoo Finance, and blockchain data.",
    "Support live trading with real-time market data, WebSocket, and Webhook integrations.",
    "Monitor trading operations in real-time with runtime reporting and configurable monitoring tools.",
    "Ensure robust and informative exception handling for API, trading, and authentication errors."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "QuantStrategy Abstract Base Class for defining custom trading strategies with signal generation and position calculation methods.",
    "Utility functions for accurately calculating returns and Sharpe ratio, handling edge cases such as empty or single-value data.",
    "Multi-exchange support including the 1024 Exchange with modular Perp, Spot, Prediction, Championship, and Account trading modules.",
    "Unified interfaces for retrieving market data, trading operations, managing positions, and advanced order types.",
    "Multi-source Data Retrieval system with adapters for exchanges, financial data providers, and blockchain data sources.",
    "Live Trading components including LiveTrader and start_trading entry point supporting WebSocket and Webhook integration for real-time execution.",
    "Monitoring and reporting tools with RuntimeReporter and RuntimeConfig for tracking trading activity and system state.",
    "Comprehensive exception hierarchy to manage authentication, rate limits, invalid inputs, margin issues, order and market errors, improving reliability and debuggability."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User creates a custom trading strategy by inheriting from QuantStrategy, implementing generate_signals() and calculate_position().",
    "User backtests the strategy using historical data via backtest() to evaluate performance.",
    "User utilizes utility functions to calculate returns and Sharpe ratio from price series for performance measurement.",
    "User connects to exchanges like 1024 Exchange through the BaseExchange interface and accesses modular APIs for different trading functionalities.",
    "User retrieves market and financial data from multiple sources using DataRetriever and BacktestDataset with support for different data adapters.",
    "User initiates live trading sessions via LiveTrader, receiving real-time market data through WebSocket and managing orders with Webhook callbacks.",
    "User monitors trading activities and runtime state in real-time using RuntimeReporter and configures monitoring behaviors with RuntimeConfig.",
    "Application gracefully handles exceptions via custom exception classes providing clear error messaging without crashing the system."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Custom strategies must inherit QuantStrategy and implement required methods generate_signals() and calculate_position().",
    "Backtesting executes successfully producing meaningful performance outputs.",
    "Utility functions calculate_returns() and calculate_sharpe_ratio() handle edge cases correctly and produce accurate results.",
    "Exchange integration through Exchange1024ex supports authentication, modular API access, and trading operations.",
    "Data retrieval aggregates data from multiple sources with standardized format and error handling.",
    "Live trading sessions start successfully, process real-time data feeds, and complete trade executions.",
    "Monitoring tools report trading activity reliably and support configuration adjustments at runtime.",
    "All custom exceptions derive from Quant1024Exception with informative messages and do not cause application crashes."
